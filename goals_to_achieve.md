# Ideally we would want to fulfill these goals

1. have at least one functioning “wow” example that I can run (by copy-paste) and understand without difficulty 
2. a link to the software development page, such as r-forge or Github 
3. Can a typical user know how to get her/his data into the package's functions
4. is there adequate documentation
5. if they type ?newphypackage will they get something useful 
6. use a  test unit for the package
