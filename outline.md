## PyPhylogenomics Outline

1. phylogenomic approaches are needed to resolve the tree of life in diverse clades.
    * Nowadays, whole-genome datasets are being used to resolve species phylogenies of some taxa 
      of interest [@eisen2003] for example mammals [@romiguier2013], molluscs [@kocot2013], horses [@vilstrup2013].
        * Resolved phylogenies are needed because can be applied to studies using the comparative method [@felsenstein1985].
 	* many clades therefore need to move beyond 5 - 10 genes, and begin accessing 100 to 1000's of genes. 
	* genes to use, etc.
3. most research groups are doing this via the transcriptome [@cui2013].
	* Regiers approach of using cDNA, 
	* i5K transcriptome projects .. 
4. Problems with the transcriptome approach 
	* not going to work on degraded museum specimens. 
	* what is needed .... long exons for single copy genes
	* Wahlber and Wheat were focused upon generating markers compatible with such material. 
	* Here we extend that approach with a tool for the community
