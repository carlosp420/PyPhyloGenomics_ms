## PyPhylogenomics Outline

1. Resolved phylogenies are needed because can be applied to studies using the
        comparative method [@felsenstein1985].
    * phylogenomic approaches are needed to resolve the tree of life in diverse
      clades.
 	* many clades therefore need to move beyond 5 - 10 genes, and begin
      accessing 100 to 1000's of genes due to, for example, coalescent
      stochasticity [@leache2011].
	* genes to use, etc.
2. Whole genome sequencing
    * Nowadays, whole-genome datasets of related species are being used to
      resolve species phylogenies of some taxa of interest [@eisen2003] for 
      example mammals [@romiguier2013], molluscs [@kocot2013], horses 
      [@vilstrup2013] but this is still costly [@metzker2010].
3. Amplicon sequencing (target sequencing)
    * a few genes 
    * or all exons (exome)
3. Transcriptome analysis
    * RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq): use RNA to generate cDNA to be sequenced which
      allows estimating gene structure such as start, end and splicing patterns
      [@wang2009]. Used in *Melitaea cinxia* [@vera2008].
    * most research groups are doing this [@cui2013].
    * gene expression profiling
	* Regiers approach of using cDNA, 
	* i5K transcriptome projects .. 

4. Hybrid enrichment (sequence capture)
    * "Pull-down" method by @lemmon2012: use a few model species to design
      highly conserved probes of short genomic sequences flanked by less
      conserved regions that were captured using hybridization with genomes of
      non-model species. 

    * Hybrid enrichment (a.k.a. sequence capture) uses oligonucleotides as
      baits that hybridize to genomic fragments containing the target sequence
      and allows target loci to be separated from nontarget regions of the
      genome (Albert et al. 2007; Gnirke et al. 2009).

5. RADseq, 
6. pull-down capture methods like the Lemmon reference I sent you
4. Problems with the transcriptome approach 
	* not going to work on degraded museum specimens. 
	* what is needed .... long exons for single copy genes
	* Wahlberg and Wheat were focused upon generating markers compatible with 
      such material. 
	* Here we extend that approach with a tool for the community

5. Targeted re-sequencing,
