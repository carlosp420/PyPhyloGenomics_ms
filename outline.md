## PyPhylogenomics Outline

1. Resolved phylogenies are needed because can be applied to studies using the
        comparative method [@felsenstein1985].
    * phylogenomic approaches are needed to resolve the tree of life in diverse
      clades.
 	* many clades therefore need to move beyond 5 - 10 genes, and begin
      accessing 100 to 1000's of genes. 
	* genes to use, etc.
2. Whole genome sequencing
    * Nowadays, whole-genome datasets of related species are being used to
      resolve species phylogenies of some taxa of interest [@eisen2003] for 
      example mammals [@romiguier2013], molluscs [@kocot2013], horses 
      [@vilstrup2013] but this is still costly [@metzker2010].
3. Amplicon sequencing (target sequencing)
    * a few genes 
    * or all exons (exome)
3. Transcriptome analysis
    * RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq): use RNA to generate cDNA and estimate gene 
      structure such as start, end, splicing patterns etc [@wang2009]. In 
      *Melitaea* [@vera2008].
    * most research groups are doing this [@cui2013].
    * gene expression profiling
	* Regiers approach of using cDNA, 
	* i5K transcriptome projects .. 
4. Hybridization
    * 10.1038/NMETH.1419
5. RADseq, 
6. pull-down capture methods like the Lemmon reference I sent you
4. Problems with the transcriptome approach 
	* not going to work on degraded museum specimens. 
	* what is needed .... long exons for single copy genes
	* Wahlberg and Wheat were focused upon generating markers compatible with 
      such material. 
	* Here we extend that approach with a tool for the community

5. Targeted re-sequencing,
